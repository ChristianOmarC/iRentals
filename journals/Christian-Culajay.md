Today the team tried to get our database set-up and succeeded.

Team migrated the database and worked on the backend authentication, we're about half way through. We now know how to expertly navigate any migrations history errors!

Installed redux with the team and implemented a test case for list properties, officially completed our frontend auth!

I was out sick unfortunately, but the team got a massive head start on our form for creating a property, listing properties, and property details.

3/12/24
Today we finished the forms for creating a property and reservation, along with showing the property details! The merge conflicts today were insurmountable, Gitlab do be hurting my brain sometimes.


3/13/24

Prayag created a nav bar and Murray added a dashboard to it, also updated our property card.


3/14/24
FINALLY GOT OUR MVP COMPLETED, just need to dot some I’s and cross some t’s.


3/18/24
Team worked together to debug some frontend auth for certain paths along with improving our property card and trying to auto populate our propertyID’s name to the reservation the user wants to make.

3/19/24
I was able to debug almost all of the frontend auth thanks to Riley pointing me in the right direction with Redux documentation.
I keep forgetting the importance of looking through the right docs for the new things we implement so today was an amazing reminder of that. Te3am struggled with git merging and had to perform a git reset to push back 50 commits. Ended the day with another merge conflict. Also figured out a frontend workaround for user usability that allows certain features to only be shown if the current account_id matched the account_id the data is associated with.
